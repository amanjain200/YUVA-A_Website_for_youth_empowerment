            ‚ÄúI was addicted to heroin for 10 years, and I had lost everything:
            my family, my friends, my job, my health. I had tried to quit many
            times, but I always relapsed. I felt hopeless and worthless. Then I
            found YUVA, and it changed my life. They helped me get into a detox
            and a rehab program, and they gave me free therapy and support. They
            also connected me with other people who were in recovery, and they
            encouraged me to join their activities and campaigns. They made me
            feel like I was part of something bigger than myself, and that I had
            a purpose and a future. Thanks to YUVA, I have been sober for 2
            years, and I am happy and grateful for every day.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúI started using drugs when I was 14, because I wanted to fit in
            with the cool kids. I didn‚Äôt know the risks and the consequences of
            drug use, and I didn‚Äôt care. I thought it was fun and harmless. But
            soon, I realized that drugs were ruining my life. I was failing in
            school, I was getting into trouble with the law, and I was losing my
            friends and family. I wanted to stop, but I didn‚Äôt know how. Then I
            found YUVA, and it opened my eyes. They taught me about the harmful
            effects of drugs and how to protect myself and my friends from them.
            They also gave me a QnA test and a chatbot that helped me with my
            mental health issues. They also inspired me with their stories and
            messages, and they helped me make smart choices and overcome
            challenges in life. Thanks to YUVA, I have been drug-free for 6
            months, and I am proud and confident of myself.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúI was a victim of drug trafficking, and I was forced to use and
            sell drugs by a gang. I was scared and trapped, and I didn‚Äôt know
            how to escape. I felt like I had no hope and no help. Then I found
            YUVA, and it saved my life. They helped me call their emergency
            helpline, and they sent the police and the NCB to rescue me. They
            also gave me free and private help for my addiction and trauma, and
            they helped me find a safe and supportive place to live. They also
            involved me in their positive and constructive actions, and they
            rewarded me for reporting crimes and making a difference in my
            community. They also connected me with mini-influencers,
            celebrities, and experts who promoted drug-free lifestyle, and they
            made me feel like I was not alone, and that there was hope and help
            available. Thanks to YUVA, I have been free from drugs and crime for
            1 year, and I am happy and hopeful for my life.‚Äù
